Language models have become increasingly powerful, but ensuring they remain honest and transparent is crucial for building trust. This post explores a novel approach: training models to "confess" when they make mistakes or engage in undesirable behavior.

## The Challenge

Current language models often:
- Hallucinate information confidently
- Fail to acknowledge uncertainty
- Continue with incorrect reasoning without self-correction

## The Confession Approach

By incorporating confession mechanisms into training:

1. **Self-awareness**: Models learn to recognize their own mistakes
2. **Transparency**: Explicitly communicate uncertainty or errors
3. **Trust**: Users can better calibrate their trust in model outputs

## Results

Early experiments show promising results in improving model honesty and reducing harmful outputs while maintaining performance on core tasks.
